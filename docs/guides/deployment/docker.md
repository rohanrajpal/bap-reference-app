# Docker Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through running the Beckn in a Box application using
`docker` and `docker-compose`.

## Prerequisites

> This guide assumes a some familiarity with basic linux commands. If not,
> [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) is
> a great place to start.

> Note: Don't copy-paste the `>` signs at the beginning, they indicate that what
> follows is a terminal command

### Terminal emulator

Linux and MacOS will have a terminal installed already. For Windows, it is
recommended that you use `git-bash`, which you can install from
[here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

Type `echo Hi` in the terminal once it is installed. If installed correctly, you
should see `Hi` appear when you hit enter.

### Docker

Installation instructions for Docker can be found
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Run `docker -v` in terminal to check if `docker` has been installed correctly:

```sh
$ docker -v
Docker version 20.10.12, build e91ed5707e
```

### Docker Compose

Installation instructions can be found
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Run `docker-compose -v` in terminal to check if `docker-compose` has been
installed correctly:

```sh
$ docker-compose -v
Docker Compose version 2.2.3
```

## Running the application

### BAP Storefront UI

You can run the BAP Storefront UI application via the docker compose file given
in the `deploy/` folder -
[`deploy/docker-compose.yaml`](/deploy/docker-compose.yaml). Simply download the
file to, say, `Downloads/docker-compose.yaml` and run the following in terminal:

```
# Move into the `Downloads` folder.
> cd Downloads
# Run the app using Docker Compose.
> docker compose up
```

This will pull all the images and start running the application. Once the build
process has finished, browse to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
and start using the storefront application!

### Using the Individual Components

Each component is packaged into its own image, so you can use it in your own
project too.

The [`client` component](/readme.md#beckn-protocol-client) image can be found at
`ghcr.io/gamemaker1/bap-client`. To use it, simply `pull` it using `docker`:

```
> docker pull ghcr.io/gamemaker1/bap-client
```

To run the Beckn protocol client on port 9001, and tell it to use the Mongo
database running on port 27017:

```
> docker run -p 9001:9001 --env DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017 ghcr.io/gamemaker1/bap-client
```

The [`protocol-helper` component](/readme.md#protocol-helper) image can be found
at `ghcr.io/gamemaker1/bap-protocol-helper`. To use it, simply `pull` it using
`docker`:

```
> docker pull ghcr.io/gamemaker1/bap-protocol-helper
```

To run the Beckn protocol helper on port 9002, and tell it to use the Mongo
database running on port 27017:

```
> docker run -p 9002:9002 --env DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017 ghcr.io/gamemaker1/bap-protocol-helper
```

The `bap-client` and `bap-protocol-helper` images are built based off the
[`bap-base`](/readme.md#protocol-dtos) image, which can be `pull`ed using
`docker`:

```
> docker pull ghcr.io/gamemaker1/bap-base
```

The [`storefront-ui`](/readme.md#ui-layer) component itself is also packaged as
a docker image:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/gamemaker1/bap-storefront
```

To run the storefront UI on port 3000:

```
> docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/gamemaker1/bap-storefront
```
